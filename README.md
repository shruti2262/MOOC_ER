# A good understanding of the macroeconomic cycle with alternating recession and expansion periods (also known as the business cycle) is important for various decision makers. Macroeconomic policy is often based on predictions of this cycle, and such predictions can influence investment decisions of large companies. Central banks and other institutions often publish so-called leading indicators that are helpful to predict the state of the economy. These indicators are based on macroeconomic series like job formation, interest rates, credit, demand, and supply. This case project is to predict GDP growth by using quarterly data on a hypothetical economy from 1950 quarter 1 to 2015 quarter 4.
